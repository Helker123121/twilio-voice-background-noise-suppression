# Twilio Voice Background Noise Suppression üéß

Welcome to the **twilio-voice-background-noise-suppression** repository! This project focuses on applying filters to Twilio stream audio to effectively remove background noise. If you are looking to enhance the audio quality of your Twilio voice calls by reducing background noise interference, you are in the right place.

## üìÅ Repository Content
Inside this repository, you will find relevant code and resources to implement background noise suppression for Twilio voice calls. The key components and features include:
- Implementation of various audio filters such as band-pass filters and high-pass filters.
- Integration with Twilio's voice API to process and enhance audio streams.
- Utilization of Python for scripting and filtering audio data.
- Use of libraries like Express, Matplotlib, and ngrok for enhanced functionality.

## üöÄ Get Started

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation
The implementation of background noise suppression involves the following steps:
1. **Audio Filtering**: Apply band-pass filters and biquad filters to the Twilio audio stream to target specific frequency ranges and remove unwanted noise.
2. **Integration with Twilio API**: Use Twilio's voice API to capture and process the audio stream in real-time, applying the necessary filters for noise suppression.
3. **Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib to visualize the audio data before and after applying the filters to ensure effective noise reduction.
4. **Remote Access**: Employ ngrok to set up a secure tunnel to the local server, allowing for remote access and testing of the background noise suppression functionality.
